<p>How do I prepare for quizzes?</p>
<p>Quizzes will be timed Blackboard tests (usually around 20 minutes) consisting of true/false, matching, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short essay questions.  You may be able to use notes depending on the quiz, but studying is important due to the timed aspect of the quiz.  These quizzes must be taken alone (e.g. no collaborations).</p>
	
<p>Quizzes can contain any materials assigned in the non-optional readings (C-5 class powerpoints).&nbsp;</p>
	
<p>Quizzes can only be taken once, and they will be given during class time unless otherwise stated.</p>
