<p>Please read through these powerpoints in partial preparation for quizzes.  Don't forget to look at the "notes" sections of the powerpoints!  (Quizzes also have other components, such as any sort of materials/presentations we have had in class .  This also includes basic concepts taken from student presentations, if applicable.)</p>
<p>I will go through and answer questions in class that you may have over anything you've read in the powerpoints. Again, don't forget to read the slide notes in addition to the slides!</p>
<p>Where am I getting these powerpoints?  The powerpoints are from the <a href="https://www.ncyte.net/">NYCTE Center</a>.  These specific powerpoint materials have been adapted from the Cyber Threats &#38; Countermeasures and Applied Cryptography modules.  The NYCTE Center provides free training modules for educators in collaboration with the NSF to expand security literacy in 2 and 4 year college settings.</p>
